## 📖 Project Overview  

**Neo4j Artifact Finder** allows users to search for historical artifacts based on incomplete names of artifacts, eras, or locations. By utilizing the **FLAN-T5** language model and the **Neo4j** database, the application can:  

✅ Match partial names and suggest the correct results.  
✅ Link artifacts to their corresponding eras and locations.  
✅ Generate dynamic **Cypher** queries for Neo4j.  

This tool is useful for historians, researchers, and enthusiasts who need a structured and intelligent way to explore historical data.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **🔍 Intelligent Search:** Supports partial name searches for artifacts, eras, and locations.  
- **📊 Neo4j Integration:** Uses graph database queries to retrieve accurate historical connections.  
- **🧠 AI-Powered Processing:** FLAN-T5 analyzes user queries and refines search parameters.  
- **⚡ Fast & Efficient:** Optimized Cypher queries ensure quick database responses.  
- **💻 User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive search experience.

## ⚙️ Installation  

To set up the project, follow these steps:  

1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewakobrzynska/GraphRAG.git
cd GraphRAG
```

2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**  

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️⃣ **Install dependencies:**  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Application  

Once installed, launch the application using:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server where you can interact with the search tool.  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. **User Input:** The user enters a partial name of an artifact, era, or location.  
2. **AI Query Processing:** The **FLAN-T5** model refines and understands the search intent.  
3. **Cypher Query Generation:** A Cypher query is dynamically constructed to retrieve relevant data from the **Neo4j** database.  
4. **Result Display:** The application presents artifacts, their associated historical eras, and locations in an easy-to-read format.
